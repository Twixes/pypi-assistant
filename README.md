# [PyPI Assistant for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twixes.pypi-assistant)

## IMPORTANT

This is patched version! This version can send outdated messages for pip packages with '==' version specifiers.

This lightweight extension enables CodeLens + handy hover tooltips with PyPI package information in [pip requirements files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) (`requirements.txt`, `constraints.txt`) â€“ similar to what VS Code does by default in `package.json`. Gain access to package name, description, author(s), license, and latest version, at a glance, with links in case you need more details.

Depends on [Microsoft's Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for `pip requirements` language detection.
