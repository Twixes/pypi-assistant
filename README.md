# [PyPI Assistant for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twixes.pypi-assistant)

This lightweight extension enables handy hover tooltips with up-to-date PyPI package information in [pip requirements files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) (`requirements.txt`, `constraints.txt`), similar to what VS Code does by default in npm's `package.json`. Gain access to package name, summary, author(s) along with their email(s), license, and latest version, at a glance, with relevant links if you need more details.

Depends on [Microsoft's Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for `pip requirements` language detection.
