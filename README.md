# PyPI Assistant for VS Code

This lightweight extension enables handy hover tooltips with up-to-date PyPI package information in [pip requirements files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) (`requirements.txt`, `constraints.txt`). Gain access to package name, summary, author(s) along with their email(s), license, and latest version at a glance, with relevant links if you need more details or source code.

**You must have the [Python extension for VS Code from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed along with PyPI Assistant for `pip requirements` language detection.**
